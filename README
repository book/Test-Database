Test-Database

There's plenty of modules which need a database, and they all have
to be configured differently and they're always a PITA when you first
install and each and every time they upgrade. -- Michael Schwern

Test::Database provides a simple way for test authors to request
a test database, without worrying about environment variables or the
test host configuration.
